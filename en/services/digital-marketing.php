									<div class="one-problem">
										<b>Digital Advertising, SEO, and Design agencies cannot work with each other well</b><br/>
										In addition to advertising, digital marketing actually includes the right Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and attractive design. However, it is still difficult to find companies that are able to handle these three elements at once. For this reason, many business people end up using separate agencies. In this case, the problem that is often complained about is the failure of communication and cooperation between the three.<br><br>You will not find that kind of problem at LOGIQUE. In addition to running targeted digital advertising campaigns, we also provide SEO maximization services for websites, as well as creating designs for both advertising, product content, and updating your website.

									</div>
									<div class="one-problem">
										<b>Most website visitor traffic only depends on advertising</b><br/>
										After the digital advertising campaign ends, many businesses find that their website traffic has dropped dramatically. LOGIQUE provides services that balance Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and SEO. Thus, the traffic that your website gets not only from advertising, but also organically from your business target through popular search engines (Google, Bing, etc.). We will do this optimization regularly according to your needs.
									</div>
									<div class="one-problem">
										<b>The applied Digital Marketing strategy is not in accordance with business objectives</b><br/>
										Digital marketing has many variants of campaign objectives, and the strategies implemented can vary. Many business people are still wrong in determining the right objective and digital marketing strategies that are appropriate and in accordance with their goals or business targets, so that product marketing funds are wasted.<br><br>With LOGIQUE, your business will be thoroughly analyzed in advance, including the possibility of existing competitors. After that, we will offer the best strategies and approaches that fit your business goals and objectives, so you can ensure that your business will be handled appropriately.
									</div>
									<div class="one-problem">
										<b>Marketing contents are made less attractive to the target</b><br/>
										Making content that is too rigid or excessive will certainly not attract an audience that is your business target. LOGIQUE understands, content in SEM has different packaging than SEO. Apart from being creative and attractive to the audience, successful marketing content needs to follow the algorithmic calculation characteristics of each digital advertising platform (Search Ads, FB Ads, etc.). LOGIQUE always ensures that your marketing content is creatively created, if necessary with a design that is also interesting, targeted and certainly gives a conversion for your business.
