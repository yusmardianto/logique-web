              PT Adi Sarana Armada Tbk (ASSA) is currently the largest transportation service company operating within Indonesia. This company provides a variety of services ranging from corporate vehicle rental services (ASSA Rent), transportation logistics (ASSA Logistics), driver services (ASSA Driver Service), and many more.
              <br><br>
              To date, ASSA manages more than 26,278 vehicles and more than 4,631 drivers. ASSA has also served more than 1,500 corporations operating within Indonesia and will continue to expand its service area to almost all major cities within Indonesia.
              <br><br>
              As part of the company's utmost commitment to quality and becoming a "Trusted Partner in Transportation Services", ASSA prioritizes quality management, environmental & safety protocols, as well as occupational health management systems. This has been realized through ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001 certificates.

              <p class="cs-desc">
              Seeing the large number of vehicles and drivers that require management, ASSA has realized a need for an integrated management system to organize the fleets within each pool. The system must also include a comprehensive range of functions, such as being able to offer information regarding vehicle stocks, locations & conditions, service schedules for vendors, the operation of driver schedules, fuel consumption, as well as other issues. This is needed so that companies can better manage their business processes effectively, increasing customer satisfaction and maintaining durable vehicle performances. 
              <br><br>
              In order to realize this, ASSA has established a cooperative relationship with LOGIQUE DIGITAL INDONESIA with the development of the ASSA Fleet Management System (FMS) web application. This is supported by the BASTK mobile application and was designed to facilitate the process of renting vehicles owned by ASSA.
              <br><br>
              It is hoped that through this technology (appropriately named ASSA FMS), the company can manage thousands of leased fleet units in a more organized manner, from better and more efficient vehicle inspections, deliveries and recalls, to the effective maintenance & management of the vehicles themselves.

              <p class="cs-desc custom4">
              As a leader in the provision of transportation services throughout Indonesia, ASSA maintains its focus in its ability to carry out effective vehicle management procedures. This is required so that companies can maintain or even improve levels of customer satisfaction, in the hope of the vehicle delivery process becoming a quicker and smoother endeavor.
              <br><br>
              This presents a general challenge for the transportation industry, especially for companies that are responsible for a large number of vehicles. This challenge lies in the fact that the manual vehicle management process is no longer possible. Managing vehicle lists through the use of spreadsheet documents by manually filling in vehicle data such as the type, color, driver, delivery date, and towing date will indeed take up a significant amount of time and further have a high chance of human error. This is coupled with the administrative handover process, which itself can be quite complicated, making the vehicle handover step a much more laborious process than it could be.
              <br><br>
              Another challenge that needs to be faced is in relation to the management of vehicle availability. This will present a problem if the company is unable to accurately track the number of vehicles that they own, both those within the pool as well as those that are being used outside. If this is allowed, the company will not be able to ensure that their vehicles will be available for use by the tenants.
              <br><br>
              Additionally, transportation companies, especially in regards to vehicle rental services, must also possess the ability to track the conditions and documents with detail when the vehicle is eventually returned by the consumer. This process is important, so that the company can immediately take the necessary actions if a problem has occurred with the vehicle.

              <p class="cs-desc">
              The Fleet Management System (FMS) functions to properly manage and monitor leased vehicles. This system can perform a variety of tasks, from tracking the location of the vehicle, improving driver safety and security, to helping ensure the vehicle is always in top condition.
              <br><br>
              Broadly speaking, FMS will provide several solutions for transportation service providers, namely:
              <br><br>
                <ul class="ula">
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Supervising Vehicle Conditions</b></p>
                    <p class="normal-">With the help of FMS, companies can thoroughly monitor any vehicle in real-time. Companies can find out the available stock of vehicles within the pool, see if the vehicle is still on the way, or check if the customer has safely received the vehicle that they ordered.</p>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Collecting Vehicle Data</b></p>
                    <p class="normal-" style="margin-bottom:10px;">Vehicles that are rented must be in condition in order to maintain the safety of both the driver and passenger. Therefore, companies need to monitor the condition of all their vehicles by collecting various data, such as:</p>
                    <p class="normal-"><span></span>Vehicle tracker and diagnostics</p>
                    <p class="normal- mb-2-">Real time data regarding the location and status of the vehicle can be used to track vehicles that are experiencing problems, so that the company can immediately send a replacement vehicle or send assistance to the driver.</p>
                    <p class="normal-"><span></span>Vehicle maintenance scheduling</p>
                    <p class="normal- mb-2-">The FMS may include maintenance alerts so as to ensure that the vehicle receives the proper services.</p>
                    <p class="normal-"><span></span>Fuel consumption tracker</p>
                    <p class="normal- mb-2-">FMS will also help track fuel usages so companies can better manage costs.</p>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Supervising the Vehicle Delivery & Withdrawal Process</b></p>
                    <p class="normal-">Companies need to monitor the efficient process of sending and withdrawing vehicles. This is necessary to monitor the safety of the vehicle and the driver while on the way, manage driver service hours, as well as ensure the best service is provided for consumers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="normal-">FMS can perform delivery management and vehicle withdrawals well. The process of sending vehicles to the tenant's location can be carried out in an organized manner because the system will make note of and inform the user of all the appropriate delivery details, starting from the vehicle type, the delivery date, the assigned driver, the delivery’s status, the consumer’s name, and other important articles of data.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="normal-">The same goes for the withdrawal management process. FMS will detail all the appropriate data related to the management of vehicle withdrawals from the customer's location. In addition, a comprehensive FMS also allows for companies to be able to carry out BASTK processes digitally.</p>

              In developing the ASSA Fleet Management System (FMS) web application, there were a variety of technologies used. Some of them, such as the Laravel framework, were chosen because of their inherent advantages, namely support for the MVC structure, scalability, good security, and a lighter performance. Lumen was also used as a micro framework for API development with the aim of providing high speeds and response times. Then, regarding the Front End, the Bootstrap Framework was used so that the website application would utilize an interactive, responsive appearance, and could work well on a variety of devices.
              <br><br>
              In developing this system, ASSA sought to digitize the vehicle handover process. Therefore, we also developed a mobile application in order to perform BASTK functions. This application was developed using Kotlin so it could run well on the Android platform.
              <br><br>
              Furthermore, at the database server layer, there was MySQL, namely the Relational Database Management System (RDBS) which was based on SQL (Structured Query Language). All of the above technologies were then combined with Alibaba Cloud, possessing reliable data processing capabilities. In addition, Alibaba Cloud has provided Anti-DDoS technology which serves to provide a better level of security.

              The collaboration between PT Adi Sarana Armada Tbk (ASSA) and LOGIQUE DIGITAL INDONESIA has produced a number of positively impactful results. Through the ASSA FMS application, companies can now manage thousands of vehicles spread across a variety of branches. Furthermore, the application can easily reveal which vehicles are being used at the time, and which vehicles are currently stored within the pool.
              <br><br>
              ASSA FMS has also succeeded in greatly organizing the vehicle rental business process. From this application, companies can now manage vehicle deliveries, monitor the process of withdrawing vehicles from customers, manage certain vehicles carrying out repairs, and manage documents, some of which include assignment documents, BASTK, and others.
              <br><br>
              Overall, ASSA FMS has increased the company's overall productivity and has succeeded in assisting with an increase in profits.
