						LOGIQUE believes it is important to always think Logically. We will get rid of everything that are not necessary or nonsense. We think and take actions logically considering clients’ benefits and our benefits. The amount / energy of action after thinking will be also considered importantly. Both persons who cannot think and who cannot take action will not be evaluated in a good way at LOGIQUE.<br/><br/>
						We are aiming to be the strong company / the strong individuals that can survive in any times or period seeing current and future situation of Web industry. It shouldn’t be so hard for you to imagine that the trends change in 1-2 years and your current skill will be useless after 5 years from now. In this kind of situation, what is important is to obtain skills or strength (core competence) other than leaning necessary skills currently so that you can adopt yourself no matter how the trends change in the future. You will not be a truly strong professional if you keep on doing whatever that you already can do. LOGIQUE let you try many tasks in which you have no experience if you have passion and potential. We train and assign works to everyone to deepen each core skills.
